# ARMv7 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Emulator with C

- Developed a ARM instruction emulator that decoded instruction with bit manipulation for multiplication, memory data transfer, data processing, and branching with and without conditions(B, BL, BX, Bcc) in C.
- Implemented **4-way set-associative cache** to track data usage and minimize latency in data mapping
